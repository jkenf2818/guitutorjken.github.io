            <h3> BASIC CHORD LEARNING</h3>
            
        </div>
        <p class="chordintro">
            In music, a guitar chord is a combination of three or more notes played simultaneously, creating a harmonic sound that supports a melody or song. These chords are formed by pressing down on specific frets of the guitar strings and strumming or picking them together. A chord is simply a set of notes played together, typically three or more, that create a specific harmonic sound.To play a chord, you press down on the strings at specific frets with your fretting hand, creating a chord shape, and then strum or pick the strings with your other hand.  
            <div class="chordtypes">
           <br> Types of chords: <br>
            Open chords: These chords are played with open strings (strings not pressed down), and are a common starting point for beginners. <br>
            Power chords: These chords are typically played with two or three strings and are used in rock and other genres. <br>
            Barre chords: These chords involve pressing down on all the strings at one fret, allowing you to play the same chord shape in different parts of the fretboard. <br>

            <h3> PENTATONIC SCALE</h3>
            
        </div>
        <p class="chordintro">
            The pentatonic scale, meaning "five tones," is a musical scale with only five notes, derived from the major or minor scales, and is a fundamental tool for guitarists, especially for improvisation and soloing. ,  "Penta" means "five," so a pentatonic scale has five distinct notes within a musical octave, The pentatonic scale is formed by removing the 4th and 7th notes from the major scale, or the 2nd and 6th notes from the minor scale. The pentatonic scale is a great tool for improvising and soloing because it has fewer notes, making it easier to find "good" notes within a key and avoid "off" notes.
